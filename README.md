## Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W projects**!

This is where I post the `.uf2` files for all the C++ projects I make for my Pico W. Think of it as a mix of my personal storage and a small sharing hub for anyone interested in experimenting with these projects.

## 📦 Source Code Included

All of the full C++ source code for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W projects in this repository for them all

Each project folder (for example `pico_webserver/`) contains:
- Complete C/C++ source files
- uf2 precompiled file with the source code to check out
- Comments explaining what each part of the code does
- Instructions or notes on how to modify and build the code (where applicable)

This makes it easy to:
* Clone the repo
* Build the code yourself (no need to really just use the pre compiled uf2 file except for the website which you'd need to edit the HTML)
* Customize projects (e.g., edit the webserver’s HTML)
* Learn how the code works from top to bottom

Feel free to explore and experiment with any of the projects here! 🚀

## What You'll Find Here

* **Ready-to-flash `.uf2` files** for Raspberry Pi Pico W
* source code for all the uf2 files for yuo to scan through
* Projects are **for learning and fun**, not actively maintained
* Each project shows basic functionality, like controlling the onboard LED

## Notes

* Projects are mostly **learning experiments**
* The code is written in C++ using the **Pico SDK**
* Some projects may be very simple or just for fun

Feel free to **explore, flash, and experiment**!

# future

* Soon I will also be posting some of my micro python files for the rasberry pi pico 2 w
* For now i will be focusing on my c++ projects
* My next project will be on how to host ur own webserver off the pico 2 w (ofc it will be limited)

# license

* feel free to use these projects and try them out for ur self
* If u want one custom made feel free to drop a request and I will try make it for you
* Enjoy
