## Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W projects**!

This is where I post the `.uf2` files for all the C++ projects I make for my Pico W. Think of it as a mix of my personal storage and a small sharing hub for anyone interested in experimenting with these projects.

## What You'll Find Here

* **Ready-to-flash `.uf2` files** for Raspberry Pi Pico W
* Projects are **for learning and fun**, not actively maintained
* Each project shows basic functionality, like controlling the onboard LED

## How to Get the Source Code

I’m mostly sharing the compiled `.uf2` files here.
If you want the **full C++ source code**, just submit a request and I’ll post it for you.

## Notes

* Projects are mostly **learning experiments**
* The code is written in C++ using the **Pico SDK**
* Some projects may be very simple or just for fun

Feel free to **explore, flash, and experiment**!

# future

* Soon I will also be posting some of my micro python files for the rasberry pi pico 2 w
* For now i will be focusing on my c++ projects
* My next project will be on how to host ur own webserver off the pico 2 w (ofc it will be limited)

# license
