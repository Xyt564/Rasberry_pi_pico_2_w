## Security & Support Policy

**Project Version:** 1.0

Thank you for checking out my Raspberry Pi Pico W projects!

## Reporting Issues or Requesting Code

* These projects are mostly **for learning and fun**.
* I am **not actively maintaining** the code.
* If you discover a bug, security concern, or want access to the **full source code**, please **open an issue** in this repository.
* I will review requests and try to address them as I can, but please note that fixes may **take time** or may **not always be possible**.

## Responsible Disclosure

* If you find a **security issue**, please report it **privately via the issue tracker** rather than publicly.
* I will investigate and respond, and may update the project if a fix is feasible.

## Important Notes

* All `.uf2` files are provided **as-is**.
* Use at your own risk, especially when connecting hardware or modifying code.
* This is a **personal learning project**; it’s not intended for production or critical applications.
